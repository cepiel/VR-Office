# VR-Office
Project 2, CS 428 Virtual and Augmented Reality, Fall 2019 at the Univesity of Illinois at Chicago
Office skeleton made by Andy Johnson - ajohnson@uic.edu
The rest was me - Lucas Cepiel!

The Project makes use of VRTK v4 and Unity
# To install and run
Ensure you have VRTK v4 downloaded, and correctly! Now download the .zip or clone the repo. Open the project in unity. I used Unity 2019.2.7f2, so it is guaranteed working on that version. You should see an office setting, but if not, look for the scene in the hierarchy window and double click it. Now you can use the VR simulator in unity or hook up your own VR headset, and simply click the play button at the top center of Unity. Explore the scene! My cubicle should be in front of you and to the left.
# What I did
I customised a cubicle in an existing office space, adding some realistic office things and some funny office things. Many of the models I found online, but some of them I created in the free 3D modeling software called blender. 

The ones I created: an "easy" button, a floating portal to a beach, an uncomfortable looking chair, and a coffee mug! The rest were made by others.

Some models are interactable with physics, and can be picked up and tossed around. These objects are: the sword, cube, lightsaber, book, and mug. Interesting note, the sword and lightsaber also have orientation handles, so when you pick them up, they should snap upright with your hand on the handle, so it's like you really are wielding a blade!

Some models are programmed to be interactable! The R2-D2 model plays music as you approach, and you can only hear it when within a certain distance of him. The velociraptor by the computer monitor barks at you when you approach his bagel, so beware. When picking up the lightsaber, a glowing blue blade appears above it, and it makes a lightsaber opening sound when you pick it up! Waving it around at objects you will notice the blue light source in the blade reflecting off things. When you drop the lightsaber, you will also hear the blade retract and it will disappear! Finally, when you click the red "easy" button, you hear the guy from the commercials say "that was easy!" and a portal will appear outside the cubicle, showing you a beach (because my dream office WOULD have a portal to instantly travel to the beach.)

Thank you!
